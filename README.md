# House_Prices_Prediction
I built a predictive model to predict the sales price for each house using 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa

I used the dataset available in Kaggle. I used python in Google Collab to analyze and visualize data and train my model. I used pandas, numpy, xgboost, CatBoost and scikit-learn libraries.

I tried and tested

1. XGBRegressor
2. DecisionTreeRegressor
3. RandomForestRegressor
4. CatBoost
 After applying K-fold cross validation, CatBoost gave the best results.
