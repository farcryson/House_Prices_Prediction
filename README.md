# House_Prices_Prediction
I built a predictive model to predict the sales price for each house using 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa
I have performed Exploratory data analysis (EDA) for summarizing the main characteristics of data set.
I used the dataset available in Kaggle. I used python in Google Collab to analyze and visualize data and train my model. I used pandas, numpy, xgboost, CatBoost and scikit-learn libraries.

Multiple models were trained on the dataset and after applying K-fold cross validation, CatBoost regressor gave the best results.
